# pong

I wrote this about 6 or 7 months ago and it was minified or obfuscated at the time of transpiling.

If you clone the repo and run the code locally it works but you cannot see the Dart code in a sensible form ðŸ˜¢.

Hopefully there is a way to reverse this so if someone is interested in the working code.  

Sorry about that!
